# Sendify Code Challenge: DB Schenker Shipment Tracker MCP Server

## Design/Coding diary
used to show thought process and issues and their solutions throughout the challenge

- research on MCP standard to confirm which design choices will be the best - settled on stateless http streamable server that will return a json data
- main source for the decision: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/blob/main/docs/server.md
